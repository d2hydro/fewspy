# Fewspy installation tutorial
Fewspy can be installed with pip in any environment with the following Python-packages properly installed: Requests, Aiohttp, Pandas and Geopandas.
If you donâ€™t have such an environment, we recommend going through the following steps:

1. Download anaconda via: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

2. Go to the [environmen.yml](https://github.com/d2hydro/fewspy/blob/main/envs/environment.yml) file and click on ```Raw```, see the red line in the figure below.
